Recently, I migrated the project from Create React App to Next.js and made several major improvements in the process.\ndate: '2025-05-22'\nbanner: /static/hello-world-banner.jpg\n---\n\n## How it all started\n\nIn 2024, I began learning programming and web development, and one of my first goals was to build a personal website that I could grow alongside my skills. Rather than creating something purely functional, I wanted the site itself to be a learning project—one that allowed me to experiment, make mistakes, and improve over time.\n\nFor the visual direction, I took inspiration from classic cyberpunk films such as Ghost in the Shell (1995), Akira (1988), and The Matrix (1999). Their use of bold typography, high-contrast visuals, and digital effects influenced the overall look and feel of the site. These references helped me create a design that felt distinctive while still being practical to build as a beginner. I also added a small Ghost in the Shell reference to the [404 page](/404) to match the overall theme.\n\n![A scene from Ghost in the Shell (1995) with the Major cloaking with thermoptic camouflage; the poster for Akira; The Matrix's digital rain effect](/static/inspiration.png)\n\n## The first iteration\n\nWhen I first built the site, I was learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and React. Although React is not strictly necessary for a simple portfolio, it provided a good introduction to component-based thinking and modern frontend workflows.\n\nThe early version of the site was intentionally simple. I focused on:\n\n- Understanding how components work\n- Managing basic state and routing\n- Applying animations carefully without overcomplicating the code\n- Writing clean, readable styles\n\nAt this stage, the project was less about perfection and more about learning by building something real that I could actually deploy and use.\n\n![Thumbnail for my Clay Mockups 3D plugin](/static/clay-mockups.png)\n\n## Learning Through Iteration\n\nAs my understanding improved, I began refining the site piece by piece. Static layouts were replaced with more dynamic components, animations became smoother, and I started experimenting with lightweight 3D effects to better understand how rendering and performance work in the browser.\n\nThe site became a personal playground where I could safely test new ideas and technologies without pressure. Each update reflected something new I had learned—whether it was better project structure, cleaner styling, or improved accessibility.\n\n## Moving to a More Modern Stack\n\nLater in 2024, I migrated the project to a more modern framework to better match real-world development practices. This allowed me to:\n\n- Improve page structure and routing\n- Generate pages more efficiently\n- Write content using MDX-style files\n- Reduce unnecessary complexity from earlier experiments\n\nStyling was simplified using CSS Modules and modern CSS features, helping me avoid global style conflicts and making the codebase easier to maintain as a learner.\n\n## Challenges and Lessons\n\nBeing new to programming, I encountered several challenges—especially around navigation behavior, animations, and layout consistency. Solving these problems forced me to read documentation, debug unfamiliar issues, and better understand how browsers and frameworks actually work.\n\nThese challenges were valuable. They helped me build problem-solving habits and confidence that now carry over into other projects.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThis website represents my starting point in programming. It is not a finished product, but a record of progress. As I continue learning, I plan to keep improving the site—replacing experimental code with better solutions, adopting more web standards, and applying what I learn from larger projects.\n";
